# TODO: Install Lucide React and Use Lucide Icons in Theme Toggle

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Install lucide-react package using npm
- [x] Update ThemeToggle.tsx to import and use Sun and Moon icons from lucide-react
- [x] Verify the changes work correctly (e.g., run the app and test theme toggle)

## Notes:

- Replace inline SVGs in ThemeToggle.tsx with Lucide icons: Sun for light theme, Moon for dark theme.
- Ensure the icons have the same classes (h-5 w-5) for consistency.
- App is running on http://localhost:3001 for testing.
